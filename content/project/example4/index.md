title: BSc Thesis - "Machine Learning for di-tau invariant mass reconstruction in ATLAS"
summary: Prof. **Andreazza** at **Universit√† Studi Milano** - In my BSc thesis I exploited a Boosted Regreion Tree and a Neural Network to reconstruct the mass of the Higgs boson from its decay into tu leptons.

The existing methods to reconstruct the Higgs boson mass from its tau channel exploit either a partially reconstructed mass or the collinear approximation. Recently, the Missing Mass Calculator technique (MMC) overcame these limitations by minimising an event likelihood. In my thesis I discussed two alternative solutions that exploit machine learning techniques. These techniques are competitive with the MMC in terms of performance, evaluated in terms of the **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**, and have the advantage of being faster to compute. Firstly, I reproduced the results achieved by the Simon Fraser University group with a **Boosted Regression Tree** (BRT) through the Di-TauMassSKL package. Secondly, I enhanced the package capabilities by exploiting a **Deep Neural Network** (DNN), improving on the BRT's results and achieving **state-of-the-art** results compared to the parametric method MMC.
