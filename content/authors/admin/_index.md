I am a highly motivated PhD student at the University of Basel under the supervision of [Volker Roth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v1qj03cAAAAJ&hl=en). 
Currently, I am working to make machine learning models more expressive and interpretable at the same time. 

As a first result we improved sparsity in Bayesian graphical models with Conditional Matrix Flows (see [**NeurIPS**](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/72206) publication). 
In parallel, together with Fabricio Arend Torres we developed a physics-informed deep learning model that conserves the continuity equation by construction (see **[ICLR Spotlight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16846)** - top 5% papers). 

We also developed a comprehensive library of (conditional) Normalizing Flows in PyTorch named [FlowConductor](https://github.com/FabricioArendTorres/FlowConductor). 

As a side project, I recently helped Human Rights Watch developing a software to detect village burnings in Darfur, Sudan.

Previously, I worked on my MSc thesis with [Gunnar Rätsch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tQuQ1FwAAAAJ&hl=en) (ETH) at the interface between VAEs and meta-learning. 
As a research assistant I worked with [Aurelian Lucchi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V1ONSgIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Thomas Hofmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T3hAyLkAAAAJ&hl=en) (ETH) on a inter-disciplinary project about deep learning for gravitational wave physics. 
Previously, I also worked with [Frank Schweitzer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U5PTwZsAAAAJ&hl=en) (ETH) to help the group with data analysis tasks in three different projects.
